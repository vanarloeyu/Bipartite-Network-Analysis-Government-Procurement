## Abstract
Procurement plays a critical role in the public sector. It is focused on supporting different units of the government to play their unique roles and serve citizens. Having an efficient and transparent procurement system is essential for any government organization to execute its initiatives like healthcare, education, and risk and disaster management.
This study intends to model the complex network of government organizations, corporations, and awarded projects using the historical records available in PhilGEPS. The study focuses on the Information Technology services which supports various types of government organization and have received increased focus in todayâ€™s age of modernization and digitization. These features were selected to reveal important or dominant corporations that serve the public sector. The study also looks into different time years from two different periods, 2014 and 2019, to analyze the changes of the Philippine procurement landscape.
Using a Bipartite Network Analysis, we were able to see the growth and change of the network from 2014 and 2019. We were also able to reveal specific companies who maintained their importance in the network after 5 years. We were also able to identify important actors in the projected networks of government organizations and corporate awardees. These insights can support decisions of the government in creating policies. Additionally, it can also be used by corporations to get insights on the needs of the government and evaluate their competition.
Based on these findings, we highly recommend the development of an open-source tool that can be added to the functionalities being provided by PhilGEPS. This network analysis tool can be integrated to their monitoring system and help improve transparency and efficiency in the government procurement system.
